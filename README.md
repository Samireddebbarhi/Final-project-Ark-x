## Project Architecture 🏛️

### Model-View-Controller (MVC)

Our project architecture follows the MVC design pattern to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability:

- **Model:** Manages the data logic, including interactions with the database using Mongoose (MongoDB).
- **View:** Represents the UI components implemented with React JS and styled using TailwindCSS for a responsive and aesthetic interface.
- **Controller:** Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It receives user input, processes it (e.g., queries the model for data updates), and updates both the model and the view as necessary.
